A game in which a player-controlled fighter has to shoot down alien invaders while dodging bombs dropped.

I create different classes for each individual object such as the player, bullet, alien etc. Each time the mouse is clicked the fighter shoots a bullet that is random generated from a list of different bullet images. The aliens explode when hit by bullets and the player dies when hit by bombs dropped by aliens.
